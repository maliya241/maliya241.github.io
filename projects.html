                    <p>Lee Artworks is an art business started by Harper Lee (not the author). Miss Lee chose her color scheme and designed her logo. I set up the layout of the website.  </br> For this project, I integrated PHP, jQuery, and JavaScript as I learned them. With PHP, I was able to create boxes that would display randomly selected pictures of Miss Lee’s artwork. With the help of PHP Mailer, I was also able to put a user’s form inputs into an email that would be sent to a Lee Artworks’ email. I used jQuery to change the links in the last image in a row. The form required jQuery and JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>Socktober is a movement during the month of October to encourage people to collect and donate socks and other necessities to homeless shelters. It has become an international social movement. I was one of four selected to help build a website for this movement. I mainly took care of the graphics for the website. I created the logo, flyers, and many of the other handdrawn images found on the website.</p>

                    <p>TeenHub was built to create more involvement for my community. There are several teenagers joining gangs in my hometown because they find "friends" and "family" in those gangs. If there were more community events for teenagers to attend, then those lonely teens may find relationships outside those gangs. There actually may be several positive things for teenagers to be a part of; however, I do not know about them, and so most likely others do not either. I built this website as a solution to help teens find events in the Jackson, TN area.</p>

                    <p>This website about the Battle of Fredericksburg was built for an American History project. For the project, I was allowed to present information about a Civil War battle in any way I chose, so I decided to test my coding skills and build a website. It is simple in design, but it is the first independent website I built.</p>
